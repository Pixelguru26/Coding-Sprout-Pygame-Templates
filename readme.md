Corelib is an open source Python education package sponsored by Coding Sprout, designed to ease as much of the course development off of instructors. It provides a visually responsive framework which encourages students to explore, keeping them focused longer.

Currently it is in a mostly usable state; see exercises.md for lesson outlines and core/docs.md for detailed documentation of library usage.

A replit version exists for web-only devices such as Chromebooks. It can be forked from here: https://replit.com/@calebrtomlinson/Coding-Sprout-Shooter-Template?v=1#main.py
